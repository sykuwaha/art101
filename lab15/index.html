                   <h2>Problems</h2>
                   <p> We ran into some issues with our initial iterations of the code as we couldn’t quite figure out how to properly link the api correctly. We found that some of the api links didn’t link as easily as some of the other ones and our console returned a cors error that we didn’t know how to solve. We eventually found a different api that we were able to successfully implement. </p>
