                   <h2>Problems</h2>
                   <p> We had trouble trying to figure out how to implement the previous and next buttons for task X. We also ran into the same CORS issue as we did in the last assignment, but this time we worked around it by looking in the course discord and installing the CORS unblock extension, since we had to use the XKCD link.</p>
