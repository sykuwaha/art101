					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> We had some issues when appending the new elements. When testing the javascript in the local browser, only 1 element was showing up and there were no errors showing on the console. After looking through the javascript again, we saw that there was a typo and we had typed new1El twice. </p>
